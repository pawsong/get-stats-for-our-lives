# get-stats-for-our-lives

This project provides an Amazon Web Services (AWS) lambda function that returns statistics on the March for Our Lives, ans well as the list of all events and a lookup of nearby events.  These statics include the number of petition signatories, the number of events taking place, and the aggregate total number of people signed up to march at the events.  The function provides a REST GET API.

The project is written in TypeScript for compilation to JavaScript.

It includes components to allow cross-domain API requests (using cross-domain messaging) if deployed with api/proxy.js and an iframe that does nothing buy load that proxy.js (still to be added).

## API
For full details, see `src/static/api.ts`

`/api/stats`

  returns a `MarchForOurLivesStats` object with current statistics (see interface below.)

`/api/events`

  returns an array of all `MarchForOurLivesEvent` objects in the database.

`/api/nearby`

  requres either `zipCode` or (`latitude` and `longitude`)

  optional parameters are `maxDistanceInMeters` (an integer) and `maxResults` (the max number of reuslts to return).

  returns at most `maxResults` `MarchForOurLivesEvent` objects ranked by distance (closest first)
